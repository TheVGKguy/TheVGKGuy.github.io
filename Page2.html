        <p>"Any Key?" was Legoman's first project. He first got the idea from an episode of "The Simpsons" and thought it would be funny to make something similar to that and shareit with his friends. Despite some uneeded people telling Legoman how to pronounce control, Legoman's friends liked the project very much. To see the project, click on the image to the left.</p> </td>

        <p>"May the Forks be With You" was a combination of the Star Wars day May the Fourth be With You and Cinco de Mayo. Legoman was originally going to create a May the Fourth project and a Cinco de Mayo project, but time was unkind to Legoman, so Legoman combined the two animations. No one was expecting Legoman to make this combination, but everyone liked the idea.To see the project, click on the image to the left.</p></td>

        <p>"Scratch Week" is a famous week on Scratch where the people at MIT first created Scratch. In order to celebrate this week, Legoman created an animation that celebrates Scratch Cat and Pico, Scratch's other character. Legoman decided to create the animation with only Scratch characters (that's where the AWOS comes in) after seeing Dinoboi_Animations create a similar thing.

        <p> Legoman wanted to create a new character that can be Legoman's sidekick when Legoman's fighting crime. So, Legoman created a Lego minifigure and called him Little Lego. Little Lego was introduced into the world of Legoman when he was waking Legoman up from a nice sleep. Poor Legoman. To see the project, click on the image to the left. </p></td>

        <p>"WazzoTV Before/After griffpatch" was the first entry for Coolbe22's 3K animation contest. Legoman got the idea for this animation when he saw the fact that WazzoTV has been on Scratch longer than griffpatch has. However, griffpatch has more followers than WazzoTV. Despite not winning anything in the contest, Legoman got the ability to make people laugh with his semi-lip-syncing animation. To see the project, click on the image to the left.</p></td>

        <td> <center><h3>Legoman's Day Off</h3></center><br/>
        <p>Originally, "Legoman's Day Off" was Legoman's first animation, but was remastered because Legoman_Animator's first draft of Legoman wasn't very crowd-pleasing. The first draft of Legoman had a yellow shirt with a red Lego-piece in the middle. Somehow, people were disgusted by this version. So, Legoman_Animator edited Legoman (once) until the crowd was pleased with his apperence. To see the project, click on the image to the left.</p></td>

        <td> <center><h3>Spam Be Like...</h3></center><br/>
        <p>"Spam Be Like..." was an entry for PaddlerGames's 7k Animation Contest. It was also the first project to introduce Legoman's new OC that was designed by EVERYTHINGWASTAKEN12. Legoman wanted a new OC (original character) because he wanted to lip-sync his animations, and his old OC wasn't making that easy. And despite Legoman's lost in the contest, many people could relate to the animation. To see the project, click on the image to the left.</p></td>

        <td> <center><h3>Legoman Showcase</h3></center><br/>
        <p>"Legoman Showcase" was the second entry for PaddlerGames's 7k Animation Contest. Since Legoman changed his OC, he thought it was right to give Legoman's old OC a memorial. So, Legoman created a project that included all of the animations that Legoman's old OC starred in. From "Any Key?" to "Legoman's Day Off."

        <p>"Getting Requests" is a collab between Legoman_Animator and hello-rhino.

        <p>"400!" was a collab between Legoman_Animator and TheComputerIsCool. Both Legoman and Computer got 400 at the same time (Computer had 400 quicker, but who was keeping track?), as a celebration for 400, both Legoman and Computer made a collab of how they felt when they reached 400.

        <p>October 30th was NotYourAverageAnime's birthday. As a gift, Legoman made an animation for NotYourAverageAnime.

        <p>A few months into Scratch, Legoman was getting pretty famous. In fact, one person made an account (legoman-animater) that thought he could convince people he was Legoman. And some people believed the other guy until Legoman said something. But during the time of the legoman-animater, many people changed their credits to Legoman. And that's how Legoman got the idea of an animation. To see the project, click on the image to the left.</p></td>

        <p>"Block Combat" is a game by hello-rhino that was an entry for a game contest. Legoman remixed the project and just added his pfp and the pfp of his best friend (which at the time, was AwesomeAnim8or). Nothing really special. To see the project, click on the image to the left.</p></td>

        <p>"Hill Climb Racing" was a game that griffpatch created on Scratch in 2013. Legoman remixed the project and changed the artwork so that it was either Legoman riding a bike or Legoman riding a van. Legoman also saw some code that wasn't attached to anything, so Legoman deleted that code to prevent lag. To see the project, click on the image to the left.</p></td>
